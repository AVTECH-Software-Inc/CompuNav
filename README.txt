Compunav is the Java based Computer Navigation software. Created with ease of
use in mind, you can assign infinite action buttons to anything on your computer. 
Once set, you can modify buttons, and remove them too. And, of course, what's a 
utility program without saving your preferences.

CompuNav also comes with a basic patch system. Hosted on Google Drive, whenever 
there's a new version of CompuNav available, a notification will appear giving 
you the option to patch, or to leave it the way it is. And, of course, all 
settings will be saved!
